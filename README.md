This is a simple application that allows the user to convert PDF and EPUB files to audio in the WAV format. For PDF files, the user can select the range of pages for conversion. May not work for converting very large files. An example EPUB file with content generated by ChatGPT together with its output audio, as well as an executable Windows file containing the program, are available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y_NCpiiwoaNBbwiSiKDaQUgCrHfO5aF6?usp=sharing.
Screenshots of the application are shown below.
